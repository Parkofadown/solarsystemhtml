        <p style="padding:16px; font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5;">The Solar System is the gravitationally bound planetary system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of the objects that orbit <br>the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planents, with the remainder being smaller objects, such as the five dwarf planets hand small Solar System bodies. <br>Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly -- the moons -- two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.</p>
        <p style="padding:16px; font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5;">The solar system formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's <br>mass is in the Sun, with the majority of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter. The four smaller inner planents, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars are <br>terrestrial planents, being primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planents are giant planents, being substantially more massive than the <br>terrestrials. The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and <br>Neptune, are ice giants, being composted mostly of substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, <br>such as water, ammonia, and methane. All eight planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic.  </p>
